- a spannig tree is a subgraph that forms a tree, that all vertices are connected with the minimum edges (__weighted__ __undirected graph__)

- a cut:

1. a partition of the graph into two __disjoint__ subsets
2. __crossign edge__ are edges connecting vertices of the two disjoint sets

- __cut property__ : For any cut C, if the weight of an edge E in the cut-set of C is strictly smaller thatn the weights of all other edges of the cut-set of C, then this edge belongs to all MSTs of the graph
