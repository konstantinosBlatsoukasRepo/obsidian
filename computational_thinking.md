Techniques


- Decomposition (Breaking down a problem)
- Pattern recognition
- Generalisation (You recognise a technique that solves many different problems, so you can generalise)
- Abstraction (Map don't care about the details, only the important sutff)
- Algorithm (Steps for solving a problem)
- Evaluation (is it good?)
