glossary:

-   **Name**: A name you want to give to the resource (does this have to be unique across all resource types?)  
-   **Type**: Specifies the actual hardware resource that youâ€™re deploying.  
-   **Properties**: Specifies configuration options for your resource. Think of these as all the drop-down menus and checkbox options that you would see in the AWS console if you were to request the resource manually.  
-   **Stack**: A stack is a group of resources. These are the resources that you want to deploy, and that are specified in the YAML file.
