CIDR (Classless Inter Domain Routing)

**Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**: A virtual private cloud is a pool of networked cloud resources. It can span more than one availability zone.  

The equivalent of this would be a data center. 

However, thanks to availability zones, VPCs can span more than one physical building.
This is an amazing feature that protects against real world disasters like electrical failures, fires and similar events.
