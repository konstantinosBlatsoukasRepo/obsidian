1. session limit

Note that there is a **session time limit**

2. The default AWS region for you will be US East
3. **Budget allocated for you** 75 dollars
4. We recommend you **shut down/delete every AWS resource** (e.g., EC2, Sagemaker, Database, EMR, CloudFormation) immediately after the usage or if you are stepping away for a few hours. Otherwise, you will run out of your allocated budget of $75.

5.  **Tracking your usage**
    
    You need to make sure that you have an adequate budget available to complete your project/task. **If you hit your budget, your session will time out and your work will be lost and unrecoverable.** Options for you to stay vigilant are:
    
    -   Track your usage on the AWS web console. Go to [AWS Billing Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/), and view the monthly spending. It will list you the services constituting the spend.  
        
    -   Submit a [ticket](https://udacity.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=110806) to Student Support Services to know your current balance.
