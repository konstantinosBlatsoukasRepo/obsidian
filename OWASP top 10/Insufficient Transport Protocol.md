Insufficient Transport Protocol

how data is protected while in motion

- encrytping until session overs
- session must be destroyerd after the logout


- TLS provides encryption in transit, preventing the user credentials from being exposed

What we can do

1.  HSTS header (TLS required)

   Strict-Transport-Security header is used to enforce a TLS requirement on web application connections.

2.  Cerificate Pinning (uses public-key-pins HTTP header)
